# ix-lisbon-project-week-1

Here is the repo with the project brief and where you should push your final poker game .py file. Might be a good idea to edit this README to include a link to your blog (where in a post you should link this repo too) :) 

The deadline is **tomorrow (Friday) the 31st of May at 8pm**.

Blog is live but there isn't a description of the poker_game.py file on it or in the repo README. 

Poker game unfortunately doesn't execute fully - it gets stuck after naming players.
